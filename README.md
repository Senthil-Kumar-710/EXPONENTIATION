# Find the exponentiation of a number

## AIM:
To write a program to find the exponentiation of a number.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm
1. Get the input from the user.
2. Use exponentiation operator to find the exponentiation of a number.

## Program:
```
#Program to to find the Exponentiation of a number.
#Developed by: Senthil Kumar S
#RegisterNumber: 21500410

def exp():
    x=int(input())
    y=x**2
    return y
print("Exponentiation of a given number:",exp())
```

## Output:
![exponent](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93860256/154271065-195dbc13-cab7-4141-b24a-8748491d31e3.PNG)



## Result:
Thus the program to find the exponentiation of a given number is written and verified using python programming.
